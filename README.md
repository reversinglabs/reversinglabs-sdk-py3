# ReversingLabs SDK

The official Python SDK for using ReversingLabs services.

The idea behind this SDK is to enable easier out-of-the-box development of software integrations and automation services that need to interact with ReversingLabs.

The SDK consists of several modules, where each module represents either one ReversingLabs service, ReversingLabs appliance or the ReversingLabs TitaniumCloud.

## Module: a1000
A Python module representing the ReversingLabs A1000 malware analysis platform.
#### Class:
```python
class A1000(object):
    def __init__(self, host, username, password, token, fields_v2, ticore_fields, wait_time_seconds, retries, verify, proxies, user_agent):
```

#### Parameters:
`host` - A1000 address  
`username` - A1000 username  
`password` - A1000 password  
`token` - A1000 user token for the REST API  
`fields_v2` - optional fields that will be returned in the analysis report  
`ticore_fields` - optional fields that will be returned in the report from the TitaniumScale endpoint  
`wait_time_seconds` - wait time between each report fetching retry  
`retries` - number of report fetching retries  
`verify` - verify SSL certificate  
`proxies` - optional proxies in use  
`user_agent` - optional user agent string  

> *NOTE!*  
The default means of authorization on the ReversingLabs A1000 REST API is the token.  
If username and password are used instead, a token fetching request will be done so the token can be used in further actions without the user explicitly providing the token.

a1000 = A1000(

    retry=True,
    custom_filename="CustomName",
    tags="custom,tags,go,here",
)

json_report = response.json()
```

```python

```

#### TitaniumCloud
```python
from ReversingLabs.SDK.ticloud import FileReputation, URIStatistics, FileDownload, FileUpload


host = "https://data.reversinglabs.com"
username = "username"
password = "password"
user_agent = "MyCustom App v0.0.1"



file_reputation = FileReputation(
    host=host,
    username=username,
    password=password,
    user_agent=user_agent
)

reputation = file_reputation.get_file_reputation(
    hash_input="cf23df2207d99a74fbe169e3eba035e633b65d94",
    extended_results=True,
    show_hashes_in_results=False
)

    user_agent=user_agent
)

statistics = uri_statistics.get_uri_statistics(
    uri_input="youtube.com"
)



file_download = FileDownload(
    host=host,
    username=username,
    password=password,
    user_agent=user_agent
)

download = file_download.download_sample(
    hash_input="cf23df2207d99a74fbe169e3eba035e633b65d94"
)

with open("/path/to/file", "wb") as file_handle:
    file_handle.write(download.content)



file_upload = FileUpload(
    host=host,
    username=username,
    password=password,
    user_agent=user_agent
)

upload = file_upload.upload_sample_from_path(
    file_path="/path/to/file",
    sample_name="Custom Sample Name",
    sample_domain="webdomain.com"
)
```

#### TitaniumScale
```python
from ReversingLabs.SDK.tiscale import TitaniumScale


titanium_scale = TitaniumScale(
    host="https://tiscale.address",
    token="examplesecrettoken",  # replace with a proper token
    verify=True,
    wait_time_seconds=5,
    retries=6
)

results = titanium_scale.upload_sample_and_get_results(
    file_source=open("/path/to/file.exe", "rb"),
    full_report=True
)
```

#### Error handling
Each module raises corresponding custom exceptions according to the error status code returned in the response. 
Custom exception classes that correspond to error status codes also carry the original response object in its entirety. 
To learn how to fetch and use the response object out of the exception object, see the following examples.
```python
from ReversingLabs.SDK.ticloud import FileReputation


file_rep = FileReputation(
    host="https://data.reversinglabs.com",
    username="u/username",
    password="password"
)

try:
    resp = file_rep.get_file_reputation(hash_input="cf23df2207d99a74fbe169e3eba035e633b65d94")
except Exception as e:
    if hasattr(e, "response_object"):
        print(e.response_object.content)
    else:
        raise 
```
Same approach can also be used for A1000 and TitaniumScale.
